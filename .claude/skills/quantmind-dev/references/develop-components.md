# Component Development Workflow

How to implement or refactor code under `quantmind/`. Read this before
writing code; the architecture constraints in root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
apply throughout.

## General Loop

1. **Find the nearest existing pattern.** Locate the closest analogous
   implementation in the target module and follow its structure, naming,
   and test layout. Consistency beats novelty.
2. **Check the dependency contract** for your module (table below) before
   adding any import. `lint-imports` enforces these; if your design needs a
   forbidden import, the design is wrong — restructure, do not work around
   the contract.
3. **Implement small and flat.** Use functions for self-contained stateless
   transformations. Use a small service class to bind, at construction, the
   immutable `cfg`/policy/dependency that must stay constant across calls; the
   operand is passed per call. Binding `cfg` for batch reproducibility alone
   justifies a class (`PaperFlow(cfg).build(input)`,
   `AgenticRetriever(cfg).retrieve(...)`), and the cfg *type* may select the
   shape/strategy (typed dispatch, not a hierarchy). Do not add a class only as a
   namespace, and do not store an implicit mutable "current input" or "current
   result". Use `Protocol` over ABC and avoid framework-style class hierarchies.
   No meaningless wrappers (a method must add logic, abstraction, or a side effect
   beyond the call it wraps). No premature abstractions — extract shared code when
   the second real caller appears, not before.
4. **Add the unit test and the example** (sections below).
5. **Update the public surface** if needed: package exports, the relevant
   design or guide, and the catalog in `docs/README.md`. Update the root
   README only when its overview or quick start changes.
6. **Verify**: run targeted tests while iterating, deterministic required
   verification before handoff, and every applicable live-network component
   smoke test for changed public-network integrations.

## Module Routing

### Dependency contracts (enforced by import-linter)

| Module | May import from `quantmind.*` |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `quantmind/utils/` | nothing (leaf) |
| `quantmind/knowledge/` | nothing (leaf) |
| `quantmind/configs/` | `knowledge` only |
| `quantmind/preprocess/` | `utils` only |
| `quantmind/rag/` | `preprocess` only |
| `quantmind/library/` | `knowledge` only |
| `quantmind/mind/` | `knowledge`, `configs`, `utils` (retrieval is library-free; the `library` edge is reserved for the future collection path, not single-tree `retrieve`) |
| `quantmind/flows/`, `quantmind/magic.py` | apex — may import all of the above |

### `quantmind/knowledge/` — data standard

- Pydantic models, `frozen=True`, `extra="forbid"`.
- Every `BaseKnowledge` subclass **must** require `as_of: datetime`
  (financial time-sensitivity is mandatory) and a typed `source: SourceRef`
  (no bare strings).
- Canonical models do not select retrieval text or store vectors. Put
  rebuildable text projections in `quantmind.library`.
- Pick one shape: `FlattenKnowledge` (atomic card), `TreeKnowledge`
  (hierarchical artifact), or `GraphKnowledge` (placeholder) for conventional
  knowledge. Source-first paper revisions and independently versioned paper
  artifacts use their dedicated frozen models instead of `BaseKnowledge`.

### `quantmind/configs/` — operation cfg + typed inputs

- Extend `BaseFlowCfg`; inputs are Pydantic models or discriminated unions.
- Never `Dict[str, Any]` in signatures — model it.

### `quantmind/preprocess/` — deterministic data prep

- Fetch / format / clean / time utilities: deterministic, no LLM calls.
- Return frozen dataclasses (`Fetched`, `RawPaper`, ...), not dicts.
- Surface the common path at the package root (`from quantmind.preprocess
  import fetch_arxiv`), keep explicit submodule paths working.

### `quantmind/rag/` — opinionated document RAG

- Use LlamaIndex for chunking, indexing, retrieval, and ranking; add only the
  source/page/provenance conversion that QuantMind owns.
- Import deterministic inputs from `quantmind.preprocess`; preprocessing must
  never import RAG.
- Keep LlamaIndex types private. Return frozen QuantMind evidence values.
- Do not add a public retriever, vector-store, provider, backend registry, or
  generic query-engine hierarchy.

### `quantmind/flows/` and `quantmind/magic.py` — apex layer

- Public operations are intent-oriented async callables. Prefer a function for a
  one-off transform; use a config-bound service class when a batch must run under
  one fixed setting — bind `cfg` at construction (`PaperFlow(cfg)`), pass only the
  operand per call (`build(input)`), and let the cfg *type* select the knowledge
  shape. Instances must not hide the active input or result as mutable state, and
  side effects stay explicit.
- **A pipeline is pure processing: `input → self-contained artifact`.** It does
  not bind a `library`, persist, or retrieve. Producing the artifact fully —
  including any embeddings it carries — is the whole job. Persistence (`library`
  dump/load) and retrieval (`mind`) are downstream steps the caller chooses.
- Do not expose a half-finished intermediate (parse-only, source-only) as a
  public flow; that is a component seam owned by `preprocess`/`rag`/`knowledge`.
- Semantic operations use the OpenAI Agents SDK directly (`Agent`,
  `@function_tool`, `output_type=`); deterministic operations do not add an
  LLM. Never wrap `from agents import ...` in a facade.
- Fan-out goes through `batch_run` (bounded concurrency, error policy);
  `batch_run` rejects `memory=` at the signature layer by design.

### `quantmind/library/` — local persistence and semantic retrieval

- Persist canonical knowledge and derived artifacts; dump and load, do not
  transform. A self-contained artifact (e.g. a structure tree carrying its own
  node text and any embeddings) round-trips through `put` / `open_*` to an
  identical value. Do not make one artifact's content depend on refilling from
  another at read time.
- Keep SQLite and LlamaIndex types private; import from `knowledge` only.
- Do not add a vector-store, retriever, provider, or backend registry.

### `quantmind/mind/` — cognitive layer

- **Memory**: backends implement the `Memory` Protocol with granular `tools()`,
  `mcp_servers()`, `run_hooks()`, `reset()` — each may return an empty list; do
  not force MCP on every implementation.
- **Retrieval (pure agentic)**: `AgenticRetriever(RetrievalCfg)` reasons over one
  **self-contained** structure (`Retrievable`, a `StructureTree` today) with an
  LLM agent and returns `RetrievalEvidence` values whose `content` comes from the
  structure — no `library`, no query-time refill. The `locator` field is optional
  provenance for cross-artifact fusion, never the path to the content. `mind` is
  the **reasoning** layer; **mechanical** retrieval (semantic vector search /
  BM25) is `quantmind.library` / `quantmind.rag`, and a future hybrid path
  composes them (a semantic shortlist seeding this reasoning pass). Use the Agents
  SDK directly (`Agent`, `@function_tool`, `output_type=`, its own `RunConfig`);
  do not import `flows._runner`, and do not build a retriever/query-engine
  hierarchy — one agentic strategy, no strategy registry. See
  `contexts/design/mind/retrieval.md`.

### `quantmind/utils/`

- The logger, plus small dependency-free helpers that wrap an Agents SDK
  seam and must be shared across layers without one importing another
  (`structured_output`, `usage`). New helpers still need maintainer
  sign-off via an issue first; the default answer is "put it in the module
  that uses it".

## Public Operation Checklist

A public operation is complete only when all of these agree:

1. A stage and name consistent with `contexts/design/operations/naming.md`.
2. Typed input and config models, exported from `quantmind.configs`.
3. One intent-oriented async function, small service class, or document-scoped
   handle exported from `quantmind.flows`, with its result contract exported
   from the canonical owning layer.
4. Offline success and failure tests for the public callable, plus a
   magic-introspection test when a function follows the `(input, *, cfg)`
   convention.
5. One runnable common-path example under `examples/<module>/`.
6. A relevant design or guide and one row in `docs/README.md`.

Do not add a registry solely for discovery; package exports and the component
catalog are the discovery surfaces.

## Public-Network Source Checklist

When adding a source to an existing operation:

1. Update the typed source selection and the operation's direct dispatch.
2. Keep acquisition policy internal. Add a shared provider abstraction only
   after a second implementation demonstrates shared behavior.
3. Add offline mocked tests for parsing, boundaries, continuation after item
   failures, and completeness semantics.
4. Update the source table and design under `docs/`.
5. Add or update a component-specific
   `scripts/verify_<component>_e2e.py` and list its command in
   `docs/README.md`.
6. Add or update the component's named job in the existing
   `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` and extend the workflow's precise pull-request
   path filter. When multiple live jobs exist, use GitHub-native per-job change
   detection so only affected component jobs run. Do not add a separate
   workflow, generic runner or registry, or base E2E class. Keep live network
   work out of `scripts/verify.sh`.

## Tests

Follow the canonical [test standard](tests.md) before writing tests: where they
live, the offline-and-deterministic default suite, the change→test obligations,
and how live behavior goes in a `scripts/verify_<component>_e2e.py` slice rather
than a unit test. In short: mirror the module at `tests/<module>/test_<topic>.py`,
mock across boundaries so the suite passes offline, cover a success path **and**
a failure path per public function, and keep branch coverage from dropping (the
`pytest --cov` floor in `scripts/verify.sh`).

## Examples

- One focused example per new feature under `examples/<module>/`
  (create the directory if it does not exist yet).
- Demo the simple, common usage — one scenario per file, runnable as
  `python examples/<module>/<name>.py`, minimal setup.

## Documentation

- Docstrings: English, Google style, required on public functions and
  models.
- Public behavior changes update the relevant design or guide and the catalog
  in `docs/README.md`. Update the root README only for top-level positioning
  or quick-start changes.
