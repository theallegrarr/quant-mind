# Component Development Workflow

How to implement or refactor code under `quantmind/`. Read this before
writing code; the architecture constraints in root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
apply throughout.

## General Loop

1. **Find the nearest existing pattern.** Locate the closest analogous
   implementation in the target module and follow its structure, naming,
   and test layout. Consistency beats novelty.
2. **Check the dependency contract** for your module (table below) before
   adding any import. `lint-imports` enforces these; if your design needs a
   forbidden import, the design is wrong — restructure, do not work around
   the contract.
3. **Implement small and flat.** Pure functions over classes; `Protocol`
   over ABC; no meaningless wrappers (a method must add logic, abstraction,
   or a side effect beyond the call it wraps). No premature abstractions —
   extract shared code when the second real caller appears, not before.
4. **Add the unit test and the example** (sections below).
5. **Update the public surface** if needed: package exports, the relevant
   design or guide, and the catalog in `docs/README.md`. Update the root
   README only when its overview or quick start changes.
6. **Verify**: run targeted tests while iterating, deterministic required
   verification before handoff, and every applicable live-network component
   smoke test for changed public-network integrations.

## Module Routing

### Dependency contracts (enforced by import-linter)

| Module | May import from `quantmind.*` |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `quantmind/utils/` | nothing (leaf) |
| `quantmind/knowledge/` | nothing (leaf) |
| `quantmind/configs/` | `knowledge` only |
| `quantmind/preprocess/` | `utils` only |
| `quantmind/rag/` | `preprocess` only |
| `quantmind/flows/`, `quantmind/magic.py` | apex — may import all of the above |

### `quantmind/knowledge/` — data standard

- Pydantic models, `frozen=True`, `extra="forbid"`.
- Every `BaseKnowledge` subclass **must** require `as_of: datetime`
  (financial time-sensitivity is mandatory) and a typed `source: SourceRef`
  (no bare strings).
- Canonical models do not select retrieval text or store vectors. Put
  rebuildable text projections in `quantmind.library`.
- Pick one shape: `FlattenKnowledge` (atomic card), `TreeKnowledge`
  (hierarchical artifact), or `GraphKnowledge` (placeholder) for conventional
  knowledge. Source-first paper revisions and independently versioned paper
  artifacts use their dedicated frozen models instead of `BaseKnowledge`.

### `quantmind/configs/` — operation cfg + typed inputs

- Extend `BaseFlowCfg`; inputs are Pydantic models or discriminated unions.
- Never `Dict[str, Any]` in signatures — model it.

### `quantmind/preprocess/` — deterministic data prep

- Fetch / format / clean / time utilities: deterministic, no LLM calls.
- Return frozen dataclasses (`Fetched`, `RawPaper`, ...), not dicts.
- Surface the common path at the package root (`from quantmind.preprocess
  import fetch_arxiv`), keep explicit submodule paths working.

### `quantmind/rag/` — opinionated document RAG

- Use LlamaIndex for chunking, indexing, retrieval, and ranking; add only the
  source/page/provenance conversion that QuantMind owns.
- Import deterministic inputs from `quantmind.preprocess`; preprocessing must
  never import RAG.
- Keep LlamaIndex types private. Return frozen QuantMind evidence values.
- Do not add a public retriever, vector-store, provider, backend registry, or
  generic query-engine hierarchy.

### `quantmind/flows/` and `quantmind/magic.py` — apex layer

- Public operations are `async def` functions, not classes; state passes
  as arguments and side effects are explicit.
- Semantic operations use the OpenAI Agents SDK directly (`Agent`,
  `@function_tool`, `output_type=`); deterministic operations do not add an
  LLM. Never wrap `from agents import ...` in a facade.
- Fan-out goes through `batch_run` (bounded concurrency, error policy);
  `batch_run` rejects `memory=` at the signature layer by design.

### `quantmind/mind/` — cognitive layer

- Lands via the Agents SDK migration (tracking: #71). Backends implement
  the `Memory` Protocol with granular `tools()`, `mcp_servers()`,
  `run_hooks()`, `reset()` — each may return an empty list; do not force
  MCP on every implementation.

### `quantmind/utils/`

- Logger only. New general-purpose helpers need maintainer sign-off via an
  issue first; the default answer is "put it in the module that uses it".

## Public Operation Checklist

A public operation is complete only when all of these agree:

1. A stage and name consistent with `contexts/design/operations/naming.md`.
2. Typed input and config models, exported from `quantmind.configs`.
3. One intent-oriented `async def` operation exported from `quantmind.flows`,
   with its result contract exported from the canonical owning layer.
4. Offline success and failure tests plus a magic-introspection test when the
   operation follows the `(input, *, cfg)` convention.
5. One runnable common-path example under `examples/<module>/`.
6. A relevant design or guide and one row in `docs/README.md`.

Do not add a registry solely for discovery; package exports and the component
catalog are the discovery surfaces.

## Public-Network Source Checklist

When adding a source to an existing operation:

1. Update the typed source selection and the operation's direct dispatch.
2. Keep acquisition policy internal. Add a shared provider abstraction only
   after a second implementation demonstrates shared behavior.
3. Add offline mocked tests for parsing, boundaries, continuation after item
   failures, and completeness semantics.
4. Update the source table and design under `docs/`.
5. Add or update a component-specific
   `scripts/verify_<component>_e2e.py` and list its command in
   `docs/README.md`.
6. Add or update the component's named job in the existing
   `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` and extend the workflow's precise pull-request
   path filter. When multiple live jobs exist, use GitHub-native per-job change
   detection so only affected component jobs run. Do not add a separate
   workflow, generic runner or registry, or base E2E class. Keep live network
   work out of `scripts/verify.sh`.

## Tests

- Location mirrors the module: `tests/<module>/test_<topic>.py`.
- Subclass `unittest.TestCase` (run via pytest).
- Mock external services (network, LLM APIs, filesystem where practical);
  tests must pass offline.
- Cover the success path **and** at least one failure path per public
  function.
- Coverage floor is enforced by `pytest --cov` in `scripts/verify.sh`; new
  code should not lower branch coverage.

## Examples

- One focused example per new feature under `examples/<module>/`
  (create the directory if it does not exist yet).
- Demo the simple, common usage — one scenario per file, runnable as
  `python examples/<module>/<name>.py`, minimal setup.

## Documentation

- Docstrings: English, Google style, required on public functions and
  models.
- Public behavior changes update the relevant design or guide and the catalog
  in `docs/README.md`. Update the root README only for top-level positioning
  or quick-start changes.
