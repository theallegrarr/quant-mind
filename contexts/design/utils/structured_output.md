# Cross-provider structured output

## Quick Summary

- **Purpose**: Get a validated Pydantic object back from an Agents SDK run on any provider the SDK can route, including ones that reject strict `json_schema` structured output.
- **Read when**: Adding or changing an agent call that sets `output_type=`, or debugging a `BadRequestError` about `response_format` on a non-OpenAI model.
- **Owner**: `quantmind/utils/structured_output.py` (`run_structured`). A leaf helper; every package may import it.
- **Status**: Current behavior. One bounded fallback — no retry loop, no provider table.

## Motivation

Setting `output_type=` makes the SDK send a strict `response_format={"type": "json_schema"}`. Native OpenAI routes accept it, but some LiteLLM-routed providers (DeepSeek, ...) reject that `response_format` outright — and they reject it at *request* time, before any output exists, so a parse-stage retry cannot recover. The request itself must change: drop `output_type`, ask for `{"type": "json_object"}`, and validate the raw output in code. This must stay invisible to callers, who pass only `cfg.model`.

## The Fallback Ladder

`run_structured(output_type, *, build_agent, run)` runs one strict-first ladder:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S["run_structured()"] --> A["strict: output_type → json_schema"]
    A --> R1{"run(agent)"}
    R1 -->|success| OK["validate → return model"]
    R1 -->|BadRequestError| Q{"response_format rejected?"}
    Q -->|no| RE["re-raise unchanged"]
    Q -->|yes| B["fallback: json_object + schema in prompt"]
    B --> R2["run → raw string"] --> OK
```

1. Run the agent from `build_agent(False)` — it carries `output_type=`, so the SDK sends strict `json_schema` and returns a parsed model.
2. If that raises a `BadRequestError` whose message names the `response_format` / `json_schema` (a narrow check), run the agent from `build_agent(True)` — no `output_type`, the JSON Schema pinned into the instructions, and `response_format` forced to `json_object` — then validate the raw string locally. `json_object_instructions` / `json_object_model_settings` build that agent; a fenced-JSON strip guards Markdown wrappers.

A `BadRequestError` unrelated to `response_format` is re-raised unchanged, never masked by the fallback. Incapability is discovered by the provider's own rejection, so a capable provider always keeps the stronger strict contract.

## Layer Boundary

The helper lives in `utils` (a leaf every package may import) and takes two callbacks so it owns no runtime policy:

- `build_agent(json_object)` — how the agent is constructed at this call site (name, instructions, tools, model settings).
- `run(agent)` — which runner executes it. `flows` passes `run_with_observability`; `mind` passes its own `Runner.run` + `RunConfig`.

This is why `mind` never imports `flows`: the shared ladder is in `utils`, and each layer injects its own runner. No new runtime module is introduced.

## Non-Goals

- No provider registry or model-name prefix table — detection is the provider's own `BadRequestError`, not a static capability list. (`litellm`'s own `supports_response_schema` is unreliable, e.g. it marks `openrouter/openai/*` routes as unsupported.)
- No unbounded retry — the ladder is exactly two rungs. A malformed `json_object` result surfaces its `ValidationError`; it is not re-prompted in a loop.
- No second, tool-less "salvage" agent and no fuzzy output repair (alias remapping, UUID regex). Strict schema on capable providers removes the need.

## Verification

Offline (`tests/utils/test_structured_output.py`, plus the two call sites' tests): strict is the default; a simulated `response_format` rejection falls back to `json_object` and validates a fenced or bare string; an unrelated `BadRequestError` propagates unswallowed. Live: `scripts/verify_structure_e2e.py` exercises a real `json_object`-only provider (DeepSeek) and a strict baseline (GPT).
