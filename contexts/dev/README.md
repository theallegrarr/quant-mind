# Develop QuantMind

## Quick Summary

- **Purpose**: Route contributors and coding agents to existing development
  rules without copying them here.
- **Read when**: Extending, fixing, reviewing, testing, or publishing QuantMind.
- **Load next**: Select the single row that matches the task; load additional
  sources only when that workflow explicitly requires them.
- **Required check**: Run `bash scripts/verify.sh` for every repository change.
