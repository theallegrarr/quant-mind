"""Build a self-contained structure tree and retrieve evidence in memory.

The core path needs no library. ``PaperFlow`` binds a build config once;
``build(input)`` fetches and parses the PDF and returns a self-contained
``PaperStructureTree`` whose leaf nodes carry their own page-cited text.
``AgenticRetriever`` binds a retrieval config; ``retrieve(tree, question)``
reasons over that tree value and returns evidence with the content already in
it — no library round-trip.

The clearly-labeled OPTIONAL section then shows dump/load symmetry: a library
stores the tree standalone (no source object needed) and reopens it as an
identical self-contained value, over which ``retrieve`` behaves exactly the
same. It is not needed to retrieve.

Running this end to end needs network access (a model provider). The example is
written so it imports and type-checks offline.
