"""Apex layer — composes configs / knowledge / preprocess on the SDK.

Semantic flows such as ``paper_flow`` return ``quantmind.knowledge`` values.
Deterministic operations such as ``collect_news`` return source-faithful
``quantmind.preprocess`` values. Cross-flow utilities live alongside:

- ``batch_run`` runs any flow over a list of inputs with bounded
  concurrency and aggregated results.
- ``BatchResult`` is the shape returned by ``batch_run``.
- ``UnsupportedContentTypeError`` is raised when ``paper_flow`` does not
  resolve a page-aware PDF.
