"""TreeKnowledge — hierarchical-artifact shape.

A tree's structure carries information: nodes derive meaning from their
position under a parent. `TreeKnowledge` is the right shape for regulatory
filings (10-K parts), earnings-call transcripts (intro / Q&A / per-question),
and a future paper-navigation artifact.

Retrieval over a tree is reasoning-driven (PageIndex-style): an agent reads
the root summary plus children summaries, picks the most likely branch,
drills down, and lazy-loads leaf content. Embeddings (when available) act as
a coarse pre-filter, never as a replacement for that reasoning.
